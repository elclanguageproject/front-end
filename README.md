# ELC Language Project Front-End

This (currently) is a barebones React application built with Vite and TypeScript. The project is configured to use Jest as its testing suite.

### Getting Started

```

##### 3. Run Development Server

## Recommended Installations

For Visual Studio Code users, it's recommended they install the prettier VSCode extension created by prettier.io (it should be the extension with millions of installations and should also be verified). This will allow prettier to make changes on file saves and on code pastes, saving you from having to run `npm run make-pretty` every time a change is made.
